# BoardGame Geek API Library for .NET

[BoardGameGeek][0] (bgg) provides a simple, XML-based API for accessing game information.  Learn more about the API at [http://boardgamegeek.com][1]

This library is not offically tied to BoardGameGeek in any way.  I'm just a dude, wrapping an API in some C# code so you don't have to.
